SQL projects from my masters degree

This collection of documents demonstrates the creation of an SQL database for an estate agent. The documents contain designs and SQL code which will generate
the database and populate it with records. 

The database was designed with relational database principles, and then a subset was remade as an Object Relational database.
A NO-SQL subset was also made, designed to be used with mongoDB.
